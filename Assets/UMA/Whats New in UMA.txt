What's new in UMA 2.13a4


New compositing shaders for the Keep Textures mode that composite textures on the fly. This allows for faster UMA building, and less memory usage. The masked shader also lets you recolor portions of the mesh without having to have multiple overlays. It also allows you to tile in detail textures for higher realism.
Compositing shaders reworked to allow setting parameters from every overlay in the overlay chain. This allows for more control over the compositing shaders.
UV Attached Items: Slots can be attached to UV locations on the model.
Hair Smoosher:  A clipping plane slot is used to define the place where hair is conformed to the head. This is to stop hair from poking through hats.
New slot events: SlotBeginProcessing, SlotProcessed. These events are called when a slot is being processed, and can be used to add custom processing to slots.
Swap Slots: Conditional slot replacements. Slots can be swapped out in a recipe by tag. For example, if you have a hat that can't use the hair smoosher, you can include "hat hair" with the hat, and swap out any existing hair that is tagged with the tag provided. For example, you might want to swap and "long hair" for the hat hair, but not any short or bald hair.
Asset Index: The index will now attempt to repair itself if it becomes corrupted, or you have asked it for a slot that doesn't exist.
Asset Index: Added function to remove slot references from MeshHideAssets. This is usefult to save memory when building addressables.
Asset Index: new PrepareBuild() function for use in your build scripts to force the index to be rebuilt, fix all references, etc. Note: You will still need to call the SingleGroupGenerator to generate labels after this function is complete.
DynamicCharacterAvatar: You can specity to keep the predefined DNA ("KeepPredefinedDNA"), so it is always loaded when the character is built.
DynamicCharacterAvatar: Added SetSlot(string) function to set a slot by name. Does not need the slot specified.
Texture Combiner Utility: Reworked to make it easier to use.

Many, many bug fixes and improvements.
